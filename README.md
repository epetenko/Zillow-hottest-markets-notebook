# Zillow-hottest-markets-notebook

Note that in the past, our general target has been towns that have reached their peak home values in the past few quarters, then filtered by what places have had the highest year-over-year growth. However, as home values start to return to pre-recession levels in New Jersey, peak towns have become rarer and rarer.
