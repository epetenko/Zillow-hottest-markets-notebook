# Zillow-hottest-markets-notebook
A Pandas notebook to automatically grab NJ's hottest markets of this quarter.

See an example of the results here: https://expo.nj.com/news/g66l-2019/05/b89c67f0622661/the-town-in-each-county-where-home-values-are-increasing-most-.html

Note that in the past, our general target has been towns that have reached their peak home values in the past few quarters, then filtered by what places have had the highest year-over-year growth. However, as home values start to return to pre-recession levels in New Jersey, peak towns have become rarer and rarer. It's up to you to decide whether you want to include that requirement in the story.

I have included the last dataset I used to create the above story, however, if you change your methodology don't compare it to this.
